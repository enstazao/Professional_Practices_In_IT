\section{\textcolor{blue}{Identify the Ethical Issues}}
OpenAI emphasizes transparency and accountability. These are the ethical issues related to Sam Altman that led to his firing:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lack of Candor: Alleged failure to disclose security vulnerabilities.
    \item Self-Interest: Promoting Worldcoin (a for-profit venture) while leading OpenAI.
    \item Manipulative Behavior: Pattern of sowing division and lying to colleagues.
    \item Power-Hungry Behavior: Attempts to avoid checks on power, potentially compromising ethical leadership.
    \item Board's Decision: Firing Altman after a close vote due to behavior deemed unacceptable.
\end{itemize}

\section{\textcolor{blue}{Identify and Evaluate the Course of Actions}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Leadership: Appoint interim CEO, find an effective communicator for the CEO role.
    \item Governance: Assess the board, enhance communication, and review the commercialization strategy.
    \item Employee Well-being: Address concerns, implement retention measures.
    \item External Input: Seek advice, engage stakeholders for insights.
    \item Goal Alignment: Ensure corporate goals align with the mission.
    \item Future Planning: Mitigate risks, learn from past challenges.
    \item Negotiation: If considering Altman's return, set clear expectations.
    \item Adaptation: Foster a culture of learning and openness.
\end{itemize}
